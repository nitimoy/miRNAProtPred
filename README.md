# miRNAProtPred
A web tool for prediction of human miRNA associated with pathogens.

miRNA-ProtPred is the first online service that aids in the prediction and identification of the
human miRNA with the potential to inhibit the expression of pathogen-specific genes and
proteins. 

Why miRNA-ProtPred?

miRNA-ProtPred predicts the human miRNAs that have potential to inhibit the expression of gene/protein of different pathogens. 

Most techniques predict miRNA against human proteins, however miRNA-ProtPred is the first online server to predict human miRNA against 3’UTR, protein, RNA, or DNA of human pathogens.

Why miRNA?

•    It plays an important role in gene regulation and protein expression.

•    During pathogenic infection, the miRNA of the human host can bind with 3’ UTR of mRNA of pathogen and can inhibit the gene/protein expression and ultimately helps in disease control.

•    The FDA has not yet approved any miRNA-based therapeutics (as of 2023). However, some miRNA mimics are under different phages of clinical trials.
